The bridge spanning a 100-foot gully stood in front of him as the last obstacle blocking him from reaching his destination.

While people may have called it a "bridge", the reality was it was nothing more than splintered wooden planks held together by rotting ropes. 

It was questionable whether it would hold the weight of a child, let alone the weight of a grown man. The problem was there was no other way across the gully, and this played into his calculations of whether or not it was worth the risk of trying to cross it.

Reluctantly, he stepped onto the fragile planks, his heart pounding with uncertainty.

Each cautious step amplified the creaking and groaning of the deteriorating structure. The fear of the bridge giving way became an ever-present companion.
